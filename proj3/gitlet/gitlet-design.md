# Gitlet Design Document
author: Vibha Dabholkar

## Design Document Guidelines

Please use the following format for your Gitlet design document. Your design
document should be written in markdown, a language that allows you to nicely 
format and style a text file. Organize your design document in a way that 
will make it easy for you or a course-staff member to read.  

## 1. Classes and Data Structures

Include here any class definitions. For each class list the instance
variables and static variables (if any). Include a ***brief description***
of each variable and its purpose in the class. Your explanations in
this section should be as concise as possible. Leave the full
explanation to the following sections. You may cut this section short
if you find your document is too wordy.

### Repo
Creates a new GitLet version-control system in the current directory.

#### Field Variables
* String _message; int _timestamp: the initial automated commit 
* File _commits : contains _master
* LinkedList _master (branch): curr branch, points to the initial commit

### Commit
Create commits and add them to the log and global log

#### Field Variables
* HashMap log : the chronological order of commits
* HashMap globalLog : the randomized order of commits
* ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> : all the commits

### Staging Area
Holds all files that are edited but not added and committed

#### Field Variables
* HashMap editedFiles : all files edited but not added

## 2. Algorithms

This is where you tell us how your code works. For each class, include
a high-level description of the methods in that class. That is, do not
include a line-by-line breakdown of your code, but something you would
write in a javadoc comment above a method, ***including any edge cases
you are accounting for***. We have read the project spec too, so make
sure you do not repeat or rephrase what is stated there.  This should
be a description of how your code accomplishes what is stated in the
spec.


The length of this section depends on the complexity of the task and
the complexity of your design. However, simple explanations are
preferred. Here are some formatting tips:

* For complex tasks, like determining merge conflicts, we recommend
  that you split the task into parts. Describe your algorithm for each
  part in a separate section. Start with the simplest component and
  build up your design, one piece at a time. For example, your
  algorithms section for Merge Conflicts could have sections for:

   * Checking if a merge is necessary.
   * Determining which files (if any) have a conflict.
   * Representing the conflict in the file.
  
* Try to clearly mark titles or names of classes with white space or
  some other symbols.

### Init
Creates a new Gitlet version-control system in the current directory. This system will automatically start with one commit: a commit that contains no files and has the commit message initial commit (just like that, with no punctuation). It will have a single branch: master, which initially points to this initial commit, and master will be the current branch. The timestamp for this initial commit will be 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970 in whatever format you choose for dates (this is called "The (Unix) Epoch", represented internally by the time 0.) Since the initial commit in all repositories created by Gitlet will have exactly the same content, it follows that all repositories will automatically share this commit (they will all have the same UID) and all commits in all repositories will trace back to it.

### Add
Adds a copy of the file as it currently exists to the staging area (see the description of the commit command). For this reason, adding a file is also called staging the file for addition. Staging an already-staged file overwrites the previous entry in the staging area with the new contents. The staging area should be somewhere in .gitlet. If the current working version of the file is identical to the version in the current commit, do not stage it to be added, and remove it from the staging area if it is already there (as can happen when a file is changed, added, and then changed back). The file will no longer be staged for removal (see gitlet rm), if it was at the time of the command.

### Commit
Saves a snapshot of tracked files in the current commit and staging area so they can be restored at a later time, creating a new commit. The commit is said to be tracking the saved files. By default, each commit's snapshot of files will be exactly the same as its parent commit's snapshot of files; it will keep versions of files exactly as they are, and not update them. A commit will only update the contents of files it is tracking that have been staged for addition at the time of commit, in which case the commit will now include the version of the file that was staged instead of the version it got from its parent. A commit will save and start tracking any files that were staged for addition but weren't tracked by its parent. Finally, files tracked in the current commit may be untracked in the new commit as a result being staged for removal by the rm command (below).

### Rm
Unstage the file if it is currently staged for addition. If the file is tracked in the current commit, stage it for removal and remove the file from the working directory if the user has not already done so (do not remove it unless it is tracked in the current commit).

### Log
Starting at the current head commit, display information about each commit backwards along the commit tree until the initial commit, following the first parent commit links, ignoring any second parents found in merge commits. (In regular Git, this is what you get with git log --first-parent). This set of commit nodes is called the commit's history. For every node in this history, the information it should display is the commit id, the time the commit was made, and the commit message.

### GlobalLog
Like log, except displays information about all commits ever made. The order of the commits does not matter. Hint: there is a useful method in gitlet.Utils that will help you iterate over files within a directory.

### Find
Prints out the ids of all commits that have the given commit message, one per line. If there are multiple such commits, it prints the ids out on separate lines. The commit message is a single operand; to indicate a multiword message, put the operand in quotation marks, as for the commit command above.

### Status
Displays what branches currently exist, and marks the current branch with a *. Also displays what files have been staged for addition or removal. An example of the exact format it should follow is as follows.

### Checkout
1. Takes the version of the file as it exists in the head commit, the front of the current branch, and puts it in the working directory, overwriting the version of the file that's already there if there is one. The new version of the file is not staged.
2. Takes the version of the file as it exists in the commit with the given id, and puts it in the working directory, overwriting the version of the file that's already there if there is one. The new version of the file is not staged.
3. Takes all files in the commit at the head of the given branch, and puts them in the working directory, overwriting the versions of the files that are already there if they exist. Also, at the end of this command, the given branch will now be considered the current branch (HEAD). Any files that are tracked in the current branch but are not present in the checked-out branch are deleted. The staging area is cleared, unless the checked-out branch is the current branch (see Failure cases below).

### Branch
Creates a new branch with the given name, and points it at the current head node. A branch is nothing more than a name for a reference (a SHA-1 identifier) to a commit node. This command does NOT immediately switch to the newly created branch (just as in real Git). Before you ever call branch, your code should be running with a default branch called "master".
### Field Variables


### RmBranch
Deletes the branch with the given name. This only means to delete the pointer associated with the branch; it does not mean to delete all commits that were created under the branch, or anything like that.

### Merge
Now if we want to merge branch into master, we have two possible split points: the commits marked by the two blue arrows. You might want to think about why it can make a difference which gets used as the split point. We'll use the following rule to choose which of multiple possible split points to use:

1. Choose the candidate split point that is closest to the head of the current branch (that is, is reachable by following the fewest parent pointers along some path).
2. If multiple candidates are at the same closest distance, choose any one of them as the split point. (We will make sure that this only happens in our test cases when the resulting merge commit is the same with any of the closest choices.)

## 3. Persistence

Describe your strategy for ensuring that you don’t lose the state of your program
across multiple runs. Here are some tips for writing this section:

* This section should be structured as a list of all the times you
  will need to record the state of the program or files. For each
  case, you must prove that your design ensures correct behavior. For
  example, explain how you intend to make sure that after we call
       `java gitlet.Main add wug.txt`,
  on the next execution of
       `java gitlet.Main commit -m “modify wug.txt”`, 
  the correct commit will be made.
  
* A good strategy for reasoning about persistence is to identify which
  pieces of data are needed across multiple calls to Gitlet. Then,
  prove that the data remains consistent for all future calls.
  
* This section should also include a description of your .gitlet
  directory and any files or subdirectories you intend on including
  there.

## 4. Design Diagram

Attach a picture of your design diagram illustrating the structure of your
classes and data structures. The design diagram should make it easy to 
visualize the structure and workflow of your program.
